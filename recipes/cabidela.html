    <strong>Ingredients</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>100g of onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>400g of tomato</li>
        <li>750g of chicken</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons of salt</li>
        <li>300g of rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Preparation</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the onion and the chopped 
            garlic cloves and bay leaf in a pan with oil.</li>
        <li>Peel the tomato, clean it of seeds, 
            chop into small pieces and add to the sauté. 
            Let it cook, stirring occasionally until the tomato is tender.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken cut into pieces, season with 1 tablespoon of salt and cook, 
            with the pan covered, for about 10 minutes over moderate heat.</li>
        <li>Add hot water to cover the chicken, cover it again and 
            simmer gently for another 20 minutes. Add a little more 
            boiling water so that you have about three and a half times the volume 
            of rice. Adjust the salt, if necessary, 
            and as soon as the boiling resumes, introduce the rice. Stir and cover.</li>
        <li>After 13 minutes, add the blood, previously mixed with the vinegar. 
            Mix well and boil another 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Remove from heat and serve immediately. Serve with salad.</li>
    </ol>
